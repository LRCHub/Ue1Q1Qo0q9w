As a breath so cold
Sure as a neck tingles
Your grave
Was momentarily a freeway

Easy come and go
Payment on arrival
But it's checkmate
See, you were never a survivor
Just a poor lost soul
A poor lost soul

Save a little dough
It's full time to keep smiling
So why wait?
Get it now, get your day made
There's a whole world to escape
Watch it fade
You can reset
Get a wash
For your poor lost soul
Poor lost soul
Poor lost soul
Poor lost soul

I'm on the corner, it's all right
I got the good shit

I'm on the corner, it's all right
I got the good shit

I'm on the table, it's all right
I got the good shit
I'm on the table, it's all right
I got the good shit

I'm on the water, it's all right
I'm on the ghost ship
I'm on the water, it's all right
I'm on the ghost ship

Come on, baby, it's all right
I'm not the worst there is
Come on, baby, it's all right
I'm not the worst there is

Come on, darling, it's all right
I'm not the worst there is
Come on, darling, it's all right
I got the good shit

No time for good and evil
Making an exit incognito
Use me as your news primo
I've got a short fuse and a high libido

Hey you know I ain't one to play
Wait and watch I know what you came for
Hey you know I ain't one for games
Wait and watch as I turn the tables

Your love was so placebo
Now I got a new vaccine in vitro
Hit the gas as I pass the storm
And my past is the place for all fake people

Hey you know I ain't one to play
Wait and watch I know what you came for
Hey you know I ain't one for games
Wait and watch as I turn the tables

It was meant to be
Till you did me wrong
So I'll see ya never 'cause I'm ghosting now
You're not dead to me
But till then so long
And I'll hit ya never cause I'm ghosting
Ghosting, I'm ghosting
Never 'cause I'm ghosting now

X-ray through all your fakeness
Now I'm bout to take a long hiatus
You think you're so tenacious
You won't be laughing now when you're forced to face it

Hey you know I ain't one to play
Wait and watch I know what you came for
Hey you know I ain't one for games
Wait and watch as I turn the tables

Your love was so my station
But I'm cutting off all communications
Disgraced all of my arrangements
Every trace of your face is now erased

It was meant to be
Till you did me wrong
So I'll see ya never cause I'm ghosting now
You're not dead to me
But till then so long
And I'll hit ya never cause I'm ghosting

It was meant to be
Till you did me wrong
So I'll see ya never 'cause I'm ghosting now
You're not dead to me
But till then so long
And I'll hit ya never 'cause I'm ghosting
Ghosting, I'm ghosting
Never cause I'm ghosting now
Ghosting, I'm ghosting
Never cause I'm ghosting now

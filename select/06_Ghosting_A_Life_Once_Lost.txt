I am impatient, hard to please
No sense of serenity, habitual neurosis
Transcends into thoughts of suicide

And when this body lays lifeless
Don't patronize me by
Insisting this was all done because of you

I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not speak
I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not sleep

With abandonment of trust and self
Hope is void of longevity, a shelterless recluse
I survive without reason

And when this body lays lifeless
Don't patronize me by
Insisting this was all done because of you

I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not speak
I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not sleep

I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not speak
I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not sleep

I sacrifice myself to the lonely other
For she will not rest until
Death's arms embrace me

I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not speak
I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not sleep

I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not speak
I am beyond redemption
Even in death I will not sleep

Why do people ghost
I don't understand
What I hate the most
Is when they don't respond

Why do people ghost
They just fade away
Without a reason why
There's nothing more to say

Ghosting, ghosting
Ghosting, ghosting

A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

Why does it feel bad
Not getting a reply
Thank you for your time
Was I living in a lie

Ghosting, ghosting
Ghosting, ghosting

A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

Ghosting, ghosting

No phone call, no email, not even a text
It's toxic, it's toxic, nothing but disrespect
